# I-F_PKMN-SV
This is a little python project I am dreaming up, its a Pokemon AI Battle bot that plays like specific players.
The goal is to essentially make my friends play against their AI counterparts. I want to try to make it so you can just feed it battle data and It will play like the player you want it to from the battle data to the best of it's ability. 
I want to use a reward system and I specifically want it to be -12 pts when it clicks forfeit just so it doesnt do that (this will be on showdown and Sv)
